Hello there, I checked out the sample site link that you gave and I think I can do the job. You just need a responsive design with custom CSS animations and a little bit of Javascript functionality to make those texts appear only after the browser window has been scrolled down to a certain height. 

Below is a design image of a webpage and this link     https://dev-andalib.github.io/Waxom/   will take you to the webpage I made so do check it out

You can also check out the highlights section for my portfolio website, in the project section of my portfolio website you can find the other webpages I have worked on.
